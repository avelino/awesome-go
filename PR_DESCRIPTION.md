# feat: implement comprehensive tagging system for libraries and applications (#5823)

## Description

This PR implements infrastructure changes to support a comprehensive tagging system for the awesome-go project, addressing issue #5823. This is a **feature enhancement to the project's site generator and infrastructure**, not a package submission.

### Changes Made

- ✅ Add optional `[lib]`/`[app]` type tags for project categorization
- ✅ Add optional `[active]`/`[stalled]`/`[unmaintained]` status tags
- ✅ Implement tag parsing and validation logic in `main.go`
- ✅ Add color-coded CSS styling for visual tag distinction in `tmpl/assets/awesome-go.css`
- ✅ Update HTML templates to display tag badges with tooltips in `tmpl/category-index.tmpl.html`
- ✅ Add comprehensive test suite for tag functionality in `main_test.go`
- ✅ Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with tagging guidelines and examples
- ✅ Maintain full backwards compatibility with existing entries

### Technical Implementation Details

- **Tag Parsing**: Regex-based extraction using `parseTagsFromDescription()` function
- **CSS Styling**: Color-coded badges with responsive design (blue=lib, orange=app, green=active, yellow=stalled, red=unmaintained)
- **Template Updates**: Professional badge display with accessibility tooltips
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive validation for tag parsing, color assignment, and invalid tag detection
- **Documentation**: Clear usage guidelines in contribution documentation

Addresses #5823: Mark library/application, active/stalled/unmaintained
