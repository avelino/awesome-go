## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is NOT a Package Addition

**This PR modifies repository infrastructure (.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md), not Go packages.**

The automated quality checks are designed for Go package additions and don't apply to this repository maintenance contribution. Manual maintainer review is needed to bypass the automated checks.
